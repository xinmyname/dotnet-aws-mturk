## Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK Nuget Package ##

This code was forked from http://mturkdotnet.codeplex.com/.
It is the **source code** to a Nuget package for Amazon's Mechanical
Turk SDK for .NET. It is **not** the package itself. If you're
looking for a Nuget package for MTurk, you can compile this
one and deploy it locally. This package will **not** be published
on the public Nuget feed, as I am not the author of the SDK, 
nor am I affiliated with Amazon in anyway.
